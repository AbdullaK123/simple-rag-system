    This is a comprehensive test document for the RAG system.
    It contains multiple paragraphs and should be split into chunks.
    
    The document processing pipeline should handle this correctly,
    splitting it based on the configured chunk size and overlap.
    
    This allows us to test the complete flow from file upload
    through document preprocessing and chunking.
